## MVP and Visions
This section is kept here for the purpose of initial development of the
platform. When the idea is coherent, it will go away.

__MVP:__

* Create a course using a private git repo
* Let people sign up and pay for access to the course
    - with a Stribe/Paypal integration

The MVP is inpired from

* [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/).
* [LeanPub](http://leanpub.com/)

__Vision:__ To navigate when we construct the MVP we need to have a vision.
This is to avoid having to rewrite many things later on.

Overall there are two aspects of the system:

* __Apprenticeship subscriptions:__ All instructor using this platform
  can have a number of people being in a kind of apprenticeship. This
  can potentially include following:
    * Project supervision
    * Periodically consultations
    * Etc.
  A subscription will cost something along the lines of 50$ a week.
* __MOOC like courses:__ Students can signup at an instructor and
  buy courses. These courses does by standard not include any kind of
  supercision. An apprenticeship subsription can be bought when buying
  a course for supervision.
