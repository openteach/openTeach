# Course Repository
All course material is held in a private git repository. The repository
is hosted on GitHub.

The repository should contain a bunch of markdown files. These will be
interpreted as lesson. The lessons will be presented in alphabetic
order. One way to have good naming and enforce alphabetic order could be
as follows:

* `01-course-intro.md`
* `02-elaboration.md`
* ...
* `15-conclusion.md`
